A dictionary PWA created using React JS.

The dictionary data is fetched from external API.

The UI is designed using CSS and MUI.

The API used to support Multiple languages [Now removed] therefore the language selector is presend [but disabled]. I might enable it if the api starts supporting languages again.

Also the API supports audio pronunciation for some words. So if a word has Audio pronunciation available. User will be able to hear it when clicked on the audio component which is displayed only if audio is present.

The app shows the definitions and meanings for the word searched.

It also shows the synonyms and examples for the word searched.

The theme supports Dark Mode and Light Mode with the help of CSS and MUI.

It is a PWA so it can be installed on both Mobile and Desktop.
